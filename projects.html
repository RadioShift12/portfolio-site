                <h2>Pen Plotter</h2>
                <img src="printer.jpg" alt="Arduino Pen Plotter" class="project-img">
                <p>
                    The Pen Plotter was my first major dive into the physical world of computing. Using an Arduino 
                    microcontroller and NEMA 17 stepper motors, I built a CNC-style machine capable of drawing 
                    complex vector graphics. This project required a deep understanding of real-time signal 
                    control and precision movement. I spent a significant amount of time calibrating the motor 
                    drivers to ensure smooth motion and accurate reproduction of digital designs. The hardware 
                    was partially 3D printed, which taught me about structural integrity and mechanical prototyping. 
                    This project remains a favorite because it bridges the gap between digital code and tangible 
                    artistic output, as well as being my first project to be completed as a physical object.

                <h2>Custom Alarm Clock</h2>
                <img src="clock.png" alt="Custom ESP32 Alarm Clock" class="project-img">
                <p>
                    Built around an ESP32-S3, this custom alarm clock project focused heavily on user interface 
                    design and embedded systems. Unlike a standard clock, this device features a WiFi-enabled 
                    TFT display that pulls real-time data for weather updates. I utilized the TFT_eSPI 
                    library to create a custom graphical interface, which included tactile button navigation 
                    and an IR light sensor for controlling it remotely with a normal TV remote, or a custom made one. Developing the software in the Arduino 
                    IDE allowed me to practice memory management and asynchronous programming to ensure the 
                    clock remained responsive while handling background network requests.

                <h2>Portfolio Site</h2>

                <p>
                    This portfolio website itself represents a major milestone in my journey as a web developer. 
                    Designed from the ground up using clean HTML5 and CSS, the site reflects my commitment 
                    to accessible and innovative software. I focused on building a responsive layout that 
                    maintains a professional aesthetic. By 
                    organizing the CSS into a modular external style sheet, I ensured that the site is 
                    easy to maintain and update as my career progresses. This project allowed me to 
                    showcase my branding, technical proficiency in frontend languages, and my ability 
                    to document complex technical work in a way that is clear and visually engaging for 
                    potential collaborators.
